👋 Hi, I’m @foe-la on here! Foe-la is the pronunciation of the beginning of my name, Folasade.
👀 I am interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity because of my passion for protecting sensitive information and defending against cyber threats. I am eager to learn more about vulnerability management, threat detection, and compliance with industry regulations to ensure the security of organizations’ systems and data. My goal is to deepen my understanding of network security, incident response, and risk mitigation, while gaining hands-on experience with tools like firewalls, SIEM systems, and encryption technologies. By continually expanding my cybersecurity knowledge and skills, I aim to contribute to safeguarding organizations from evolving cyber risks.
🌱 I’m currently learning Governance, Risk and Compliance.
💞️ I am looking to collaborate with experienced cybersecurity professionals and teams to further develop my skills in areas such as vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and compliance management. By working alongside industry experts, I hope to gain hands-on experience in real-world security challenges, enhance my problem-solving abilities, and contribute to creating secure and resilient systems. I am excited to learn from others and bring my passion for protecting data and securing networks to collaborative cybersecurity projects.
